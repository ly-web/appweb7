This sample shows how to create an Appweb input filter.

Requirements
---
* [Appweb](https://embedthis.com/appweb/download.html)
* [MakeMe Build Tool](https://embedthis.com/makeme/download.html)

To build:
---
    me 

To run:
---
    me run

The server listens on port 8080. Use the "http" client utility to issue a form request:
 
     http --show --form "hello" http://localhost:8080/index.html

This will do a POST request with the text "hello" in the body. The show option will display the response
Http headers. If "hello" is in the body, then the header "X-Greeting: found" will be present. Otherwise,
the header will be set to "missing".
