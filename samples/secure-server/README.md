Secure Server Sample
===

This sample shows how to configure a secure Appweb server. This configuration uses:

* SSL for encryption of traffic
* Redirection of all traffic over SSL
* Chroot
* Login authentication 
* Sandbox resource limits
* Blowfish encryption for the password

This sample uses a self-signed certificate. In your application, you will need a real certificate.

Notes:
The password database is kept in a flat file called auth.conf. The password was created via:

    authpass --cipher blowfish --password pass5 --file auth.conf example.com ralph

Requirements
---
* [Appweb](https://embedthis.com/appweb/download.html)
* [MakeMe Build Tool](https://embedthis.com/makeme/download.html)

To build:
---

Run:

    me 

This will precompile the ESP pages and a create device node inside the chroot jail for /dev/urandom.

To run:
---
    me run

The server listens on port 8080 for HTTP traffice and 4443 for SSL. Browse to: 
 
     http://localhost:8080/

This will redirect to SSL (you will get a warning due to the self-signed certificate).
Continue and you will be prompted to login. The test username/password is ralph/pass5.
