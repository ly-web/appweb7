Tiny Server Sample
===

This sample shows how to run Appweb while limit resources to be as small as possible
using appweb.conf configuration directives.

To really shrink appweb, configure appweb from source without all features, and then 
re-add only those you need:

    ./configure --without all --with esp
    me
