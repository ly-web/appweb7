            <h2>Using PHP</h2>
            <p>Appweb supplies an in-memory PHP module that includes support for: sessions, sockets, MySQL, XML,
            XML-RPC, regular expressions, large math, calendar functions, multi-byte strings, the pear library and the
            Berkeley database.</p>
            <p>The Appweb PHP module is called mod_php.so. The module loads the PHP library which is called libphp5.so
            on Linux and libphp5.dll on Windows. You may replace the PHP library with a custom build from the PHP
            source base if you wish.</p>
            <p>The supplied PHP library was configured with the following configuration options (on Linux):</p>
            <pre>$ <b>
./configure \
    --disable-debug \
    --disable-rpath \
    --disable-cli \
    --enable-bcmath \

            <h2>Building PHP</h2>
            <p>While Appweb does not supply PHP, there is a convenient way to download, build and install PHP using the
            <a href="https://embedthis.com/pak/">Pak</a> package manager. 
            <p>The following will download, build install PHP into your appweb source tree.</p>
            <pre>$ <b>pak install php</b></pre>
            <p>Once installed, running the Appweb <em>configure</em> program with <em>--with php</em> will automatically
            locate the built PHP libraries.</p>
            <pre>$ <b>configure --with php</b></pre>
            <a id="cgi"></a>
            <h2>Using PHP via CGI</h2>
            <p>If you need to use PHP via CGI, be aware that PHP will run much more slowly. This will be especially
            apparent for small scripts where the load time for each script will be the dominant overhead.</p>
            <p>To use PHP via CGI, you will need to disable the PHP module if you want your script to use the ".php"
            extension. If your scripts do not use this extension, you can keep the PHP module enabled. To enable PHP
            via CGI, add (or uncomment) the following lines in the appweb configuration file :</p>
            <pre>
AddHandler cgiHandler .cgi .cgi-nph .bat .cmd .pl .py
Action application/x-appweb-php /usr/bin/php
</pre>
            <p>To disable the PHP module, ensure that you have commented out the following lines:</p>
            <pre>
# LoadModule php5 libphp5Module
# AddHandler php5Handler .php
</pre>
            <p>When PHP is started as a CGI interpreter, it expects that the SCRIPT_FILENAME environment variable be
            set to the name of the script to execute. In early PHP versions, it incorrectly looked at PATH_TRANSLATED
            to have the name of the script. To ensure that PHP behaves correctly and looks in SCRIPT_FILENAME, ensure
            that the "cgi.fix_pathinfo" is set to 1 in the "php.ini" file.</p>
